.📚 Library Management System
About the Project
This project is a simple Library Management System developed using Java.
The main purpose of this application is to manage library books through a console-based program. It helps users to add books, view available books, issue books, and return books easily.
The program works using a menu system where the user selects options by entering numbers. It is designed mainly to practice Java programming concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to understand how real-world systems like libraries can be implemented using Java programming. It also helps in learning how to store and manage data using classes and collections.
Features:
-Add new books to the library
-Display all books available in the library
-Issue a book to a user
-Return an issued book
-Shows whether a book is issued or available
-Simple and user-friendly console interface

Technologies Used:
-Java (Core Java)
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-ArrayList Collection Framework
-Scanner Class for user input

How the Program Works:
-The program starts with a menu.
-The user selects an option.

Based on the choice:
-A book can be added
-Books can be viewed
-A book can be issued
-A book can be returned
The system updates the book status automatically.

Project Structure:
-Book Class
 Stores book details like ID, title, author, and issue status.
